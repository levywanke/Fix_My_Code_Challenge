# Fix My Code Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Fix My Code Challenge" project! In this repository, you will find several tasks where you need to fix existing code that has bugs or incorrect behavior. Each task corresponds to a different programming language and focuses on debugging and correcting the provided code files.

### Background

Fix My Code is a project designed to help you practice debugging skills. You'll work with existing codebases in various languages, identify issues, and apply fixes without rewriting the entire code. This project is optional but offers additional grades if completed successfully.

## Tasks Overview

### 0. FizzBuzz (Python)

The task involves fixing a Python script that implements the FizzBuzz game. The output should correctly print numbers, replace multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".

### 1. Print Square (JavaScript)

Here, you need to correct a JavaScript script that's supposed to print a square of asterisks (`#`). The script takes an integer argument indicating the size of the square to print.

### 2. Sort (Ruby)

This task requires fixing a Ruby script that sorts its command-line arguments. The script currently fails to handle non-numeric inputs and needs adjustments to correctly sort numbers.

### 3. User Password (Python)

You'll debug a Python class implementation (`User`) that includes a method `is_valid_password`. The method should return `True` for correct passwords but is currently failing to do so.

### 4. Double Linked List (C)

In this task, you'll work with a C implementation of a doubly linked list. There are issues with the list operations (`add`, `delete`, `print`) that need to be identified and fixed.

## Requirements

### General

- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Compilation:** All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- **File Endings:** Ensure all modified files end with a newline character.
- **README.md:** Each task directory should include a README.md file describing the problem and solution.

## Repository Structure

The repository structure follows a consistent format:

- **GitHub Repository:** [Fix_My_Code_Challenge](https://github.com/username/Fix_My_Code_Challenge)
- **Directory:** Each task is located in the `0x00-challenge` directory.
- **Files:** Each task has a specific file that needs fixing (e.g., `0-fizzbuzz.py`, `1-print_square.js`).

## Getting Started

To get started with fixing the code:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Fix_My_Code_Challenge.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the task directory (e.g., `0x00-challenge`):
   ```bash
   cd Fix_My_Code_Challenge/0x00-challenge
   ```

3. Use your preferred editor (vi, vim, emacs) to open and modify the respective files.

4. Debug the code according to the task requirements and ensure it meets the project specifications.

5. Compile and test the code on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS to verify correctness.
